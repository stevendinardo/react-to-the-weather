# React to the Weather

A simple React app to display weather condtions and forecast. It has a respsonsive design and has the ability to change its look depending on the weather conditions and time.

## Example

Day - Phone

Night - Desktop

## Todo
In the future I would like to add the following
* More CSS effects based on the weather (rain, fog...)
* Actually implement a backend to fetch weather 
* Maybe the ability to add more than one city
